{"id":"machinator-vi7","title":"Feat: Profile/Account Pooling Directory Structure","description":"Goal: Implement the Gemini Account Pooling structure from architecture-vision.md.\n\nSpecs:\n1. Create directory structure: ~/.machinator/accounts/default/\n2. Each account subdirectory contains its own gemini config symlink/copy.\n3. Add to Setup TUI: 'Manage Accounts' option.\n4. Initial implementation: just 'default' account. Multi-account is future work.\n\nFiles:\n- orchestrator/pkg/setup/accounts.go (new - account management logic)\n- orchestrator/pkg/setup/model.go (add accounts menu item)\n\nVerification:\n- Run setup, verify 'Manage Accounts' appears in menu.\n- ~/.machinator/accounts/default/ directory exists after first run.\n\nSafety:\n- Do NOT delete or modify existing ~/.gemini. Only create new structure.\n- If this requires significant TUI changes, split into subtasks.\n\nCHALLENGE:complex","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-11T16:39:40.957759-05:00","created_by":"bryantinsley","updated_at":"2026-01-11T16:39:40.957759-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"machinator-vi7","depends_on_id":"machinator-dq2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T16:40:11.591197-05:00","created_by":"bryantinsley"},{"issue_id":"machinator-vi7","depends_on_id":"machinator-jry","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-11T16:40:11.890658-05:00","created_by":"bryantinsley"}]}
